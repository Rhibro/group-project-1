                <h2>About EcoSpace</h2>
                <p>As humans explore space, we will want to bring plants for both aesthetic and practical reasons. We
                    already know from our pioneering astronauts that fresh flowers and gardens on the International
                    Space Station create a beautiful atmosphere and take a little piece of Earth with them on their
                    journeys. EcoSpace create a new farming environment in Space, where it is a safe and non-toxic
                    environment for the plants to grow far away from earth's polutted environment. Our aim is to grow
                    non-toxic Ecological food for everyone.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>We wish to return to times where the planet had sweeping landscapes of untouched nature. Where
                    delicate ecosystems are able to thrive and grow. We want life on planet Earth to be in harmony.No
                    more factory farming taking over the Amazon rainforest, no more palm tree farms encroaching on
                    endangered orangutans, no more destruction of our natural world. We plan to grow all theresources we
                    need organically and ethically.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Team</h2>
                <p>We are a group of four members aiming to grow plants sustainably on spaceships and our aim is to
                    produce more plant based food. We hope in the future there will be more such initiations and we can
                    produce more Ecological food in Spaceships.
